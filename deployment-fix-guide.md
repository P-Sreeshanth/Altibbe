# URGENT: GitHub Pages Asset Loading Fix

## Problem Identified
Your GitHub Pages deployment is showing 404 errors for `/assets/index.js` and `/assets/index.css` because your deployed index.html file has incorrect asset references.

## Solution
I've built the correct files with proper asset paths. Here's what you need to do:

### Option 1: Quick Manual Fix (Recommended)
1. **Download these files from your Replit project**:
   - `dist/public/index.html` (✓ Fixed with relative paths)
   - `dist/public/404.html` (✓ For SPA routing)
   - `dist/public/assets/index-DFqie_9T.css` (✓ Your styles)
   - `dist/public/assets/index-DP6YX9vQ.js` (✓ Your app)
   - `dist/public/favicon.svg` (✓ Your icon)

2. **Replace files in your GitHub repository**:
   - Upload these files to your repository root
   - Commit and push the changes
   - Your site will work immediately

### Option 2: Use GitHub Actions (Automated)
1. Push the updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` from this project
2. Make sure GitHub Pages is set to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
3. The workflow will automatically fix paths and deploy

## The Fix Applied
✓ Changed `/assets/` to `./assets/` for relative paths
✓ Created 404.html for client-side routing support
✓ Added SPA redirect handling script
✓ Built with correct asset file names (index-DFqie_9T.css, index-DP6YX9vQ.js)

## Current Status
- ✅ Files built successfully
- ✅ Asset paths corrected  
- ✅ SPA routing configured
- ⏳ Waiting for deployment to GitHub Pages
