# STEP-BY-STEP FIX FOR GITHUB PAGES

## The Problem
Your GitHub Pages deployment has the wrong file references. The console shows it's trying to load stylesheets but failing.

## EXACT SOLUTION

### Step 1: Copy these EXACT files to your GitHub repository root

1. **Replace index.html** with this EXACT content (save as `index.html`):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1" />
    <title>Altibbe - Product Transparency Platform</title>
    <meta name="description" content="AI-powered product transparency analysis platform. Get comprehensive reports on health, ethical, and environmental impact of products through intelligent questioning." />
    <meta name="keywords" content="product transparency, AI analysis, health impact, ethical rating, environmental score, product reports" />
    <meta property="og:title" content="Altibbe - Product Transparency Platform" />
    <meta property="og:description" content="Make informed decisions with AI-powered product transparency reports" />
    <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="./favicon.svg" />
    <script type="module" crossorigin src="./assets/index-DP6YX9vQ.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="./assets/index-DFqie_9T.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script>
      // Handle GitHub Pages SPA redirects
      (function() {
        var redirect = sessionStorage.redirect;
        delete sessionStorage.redirect;
        if (redirect && redirect != location.href) {
          history.replaceState(null, null, redirect);
        }
      })();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

2. **Create 404.html** with the same content as index.html

3. **Create assets/ folder** and upload:
   - `assets/index-DP6YX9vQ.js` (from dist/public/assets/)
   - `assets/index-DFqie_9T.css` (from dist/public/assets/)

4. **Upload favicon.svg** (from dist/public/)

### Step 2: File Structure Check
Your GitHub repository should have:
```
/
├── index.html
├── 404.html
├── favicon.svg
└── assets/
    ├── index-DP6YX9vQ.js
    └── index-DFqie_9T.css
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push
After uploading all files, commit and push. Your site will load immediately.

## Files Ready in Your Replit Project
- Download from: `github-pages-index.html` → rename to `index.html`
- Download from: `github-pages-404.html` → rename to `404.html`
- Download from: `dist/public/assets/` → upload to `assets/` folder
- Download from: `dist/public/favicon.svg` → upload as `favicon.svg`
